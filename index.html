All 7.5 billion of us living on earth have come to this life for a purpose. The purpose can be different, and it does not matter whether or not you have an education. However, some people do need education in a particular field they want to be in for the rest of their lives.
As John F. Kennedy would say: "The goal of education is the advancement of knowledge and dissemination of truth."
If the essay weren't supposed to be a short paragraph essay, I would like to talk about the whole "truth" thing, but, for now, I'll just concentrate on the advancement of knowledge.
When I was a kid my father would always tell me that whatever I do in life, I should do it with a high quality, whether it's being an engineer, a doctor, a beggar or a thief because the quality is all that matters. In fact, anything you do in life you need some skills to actually succeed and get to the desired result--or, even exceed. It doesn't necessarily matter where you get your education, whether it's in a school, college, or a kindergarten, the significant thing is to make sure you have the perspective of succeeding in a particular field, which can be found out through educating yourself or becoming educated through a specific program.  I believe education is a way to go through the path of mastering something you like, a skill or a profession you will use to have your impact on the world the best you can. 
In short, to me, education is an extra help to your ambitions, a support to serve your virtue and to succeed.
